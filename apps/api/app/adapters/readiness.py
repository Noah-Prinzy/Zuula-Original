"""Which adapters run for real, and the production guard (ADR 0002 §7).

Every adapter's `get_*()` factory uses the real implementation when that adapter's settings
are filled in and the logging stub otherwise, which keeps local dev and the tests free of
external services. In production a stub would silently drop SMS codes, skip malware scans or
accept any captcha, so `ZUULA_ENV=production` with anything missing stops the API and the
worker at startup instead (`assert_production_ready()`), naming every missing variable.

A deployment that knowingly runs without some integrations (a demo, or a launch before the
WhatsApp number exists) lists them in `ZUULA_ALLOW_STUB_ADAPTERS`, e.g. `whatsapp,telegram`.
Those start with a warning instead. The stubs that would be unsafe in production are
switched off rather than used: sign-in with an unconfigured OAuth provider is unavailable,
and an unconfigured WhatsApp/Telegram webhook refuses every call. `ZUULA_SECRET_KEY` can
never be left at its development default.
