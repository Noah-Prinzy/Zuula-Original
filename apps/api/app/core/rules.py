"""Business rules as documented constants (P2 Step 5, extended in P3). Every value here is
cited against the CIT System Development Plan & Functional Requirements Specification v1.0.
Two are explicitly open questions the spec doesn't fully resolve — each is flagged where
it's defined, and the app's current behavior for it is documented rather than left implicit.

This module is the single source of truth for these numbers; the comment on each constant
says where it's enforced. The CCS weights and thresholds, the review SLA and the partner rate
limit are defaults: the `platform_settings` row is seeded from them, and admins change the
live values at runtime (FR-ADMIN-06, app/services/platform_settings.py).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# §9.1: how much one rating counts toward a report's CCS, by the rater's role. "Reviewer" in
# the spec's own language is the `expert` role here (FR-REVIEW's reviewers rate as experts).
# The default for platform_settings.weights, which app/services/community.py's
# community_score() uses.

# OPEN QUESTION (carried since the Step 1 contract PR, unresolved): §9.1 is silent on
# whether admins get their own weight. Current behavior (app/api/v1/ratings.py's
# add_comment): an admin's rating counts at the `public` weight above (ADMIN_RATER_ROLE
# below), not a bespoke admin weight — a disclosed choice, not an oversight. Change
# CCS_WEIGHTS and ADMIN_RATER_ROLE together if Noah answers this differently.

# §9.2: the CCS-and-total-ratings bands that decide a report's community status. The default
# for platform_settings.thresholds, which app/services/community.py's status_for() uses.

# OPEN QUESTION (carried since the Step 1 contract PR, unresolved): §9.2 escalates a report
# once its total rating count exceeds this figure; FR-RATE-05 instead talks about
# "dislikes," a different (and not currently modeled) count. This implementation follows
# §9.2's total-ratings reading — CCS_STATUS_THRESHOLDS["escalated"]["min_ratings"] above is
