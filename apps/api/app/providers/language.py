"""LanguageProvider: the interface between the submission pipeline and whatever identifies
and translates the five languages Zuula supports (FR-SUBMIT-03: English, Luganda, Acholi,
Runyankole, Ateso). The real implementation is Sunbird AI (`SunbirdLanguageProvider`); the
stub stays for local dev and the tests. See docs/adr/0003-language-provider.md.

Two jobs, matching the pipeline's `language` step (app/worker/pipeline.py's PIPELINES,
transcribed from apps/web/lib/analysis.ts: "Identifying the language and any
code-switching") and FR-EXPLAIN-05 (explanations in the submitted content's language):

- `detect()`: which of the five languages a submission is in, plus any others it switches
  into. Only needed when the submitter picked `auto` (openapi.yaml's SubmissionInput.language:
  "A LocaleCode, or `auto` to detect"); see resolve_submission_language().
- `translate()`: two directions. Inbound, the submission's text into PIVOT_LANGUAGE for the
  claims/sources/ai steps, since trusted sources and the verdict engine work in English.
  Outbound, the finished explanation from PIVOT_LANGUAGE back into the submission's language.

The pipeline calls both (app/worker/pipeline.py's `_resolve_language()`, `_to_pivot()` and
`_explain_in()`).
